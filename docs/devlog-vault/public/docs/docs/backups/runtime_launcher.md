# runtime_launcher.md

The **Runtime Launcher** is a small console program that helps assemble
command line options for `crescent_runtime`.
It lives under `tools/RuntimeLauncher` and runs on any platform
that the engine supports.

---

## Options

The launcher presents prompts for common flags:

- `--vulkan`
- `--dx11`
- `--dx12`
- `--metal`
- `--lang=<code>`
- `--display-config <file>`
- `--cloud-save`
- `--autotest[=<seconds>]`
- `--debug`
- `--nosafety`

After answering the prompts, the launcher starts `crescent_runtime`
with the selected options.

## Usage

Build the tool and run it from the build directory:

```bash
./RuntimeLauncher
```

Follow the prompts to configure the runtime and launch the game.
