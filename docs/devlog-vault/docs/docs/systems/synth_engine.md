# synth_engine.md

The **SynthEngine** generates simple waveforms in real time using OpenAL. It powers all procedural sound effects.

**Note:** All systems are modular and self-contained. See [docs/modular/game_system_tree.md](../modular/game_system_tree.md) for the latest status. A system remains **In-Progress** until its documentation, cleanup, and tests are merged and verified.

## Features

- Supports sine, square, saw, triangle and noise shapes.
- Multiple buffers stream samples through OpenAL.
- Convenience helpers play short effects like powerups or hits.
