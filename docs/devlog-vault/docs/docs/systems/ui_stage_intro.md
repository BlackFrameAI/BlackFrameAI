# ui_stage_intro.md

This document defines the **Stage Intro UI systems** for *Purge of the Crescent Veil*.

**Note:** All systems are modular and self-contained. See [docs/modular/game_system_tree.md](../modular/game_system_tree.md) for the latest status. A system remains **In-Progress** until its documentation, cleanup, and tests are merged and verified.

## Stage Intro UI Elements

- Stage intro screen
- Dynamic stage name and number
- Faction influence readout
- Alignment state display
- Lore text / narrative hooks
- StageDetailOverlay previously displayed the active stage's name and lore at
  the start of each stage. This overlay has been disabled in the default build
  but may return once intro scenes are revisited. **StageDetailOverlay is now deprecated.**

---

## Planned Features

- Stage intros should reflect current game state (alignment, world state, faction control).
