# game_class.md

The **Game** class is the main entry for gameplay. It owns all managers like `PlayerManager`, `StageManager` and `BossManager` and coordinates their updates. The engine always instantiates this class during startup; the old lightweight harness used for internal tests has been removed.

See [docs/modular/game_system_tree.md](../modular/game_system_tree.md) for the current modularization status.
