# AI Behavior Reference Manifest

This manifest provides real-world resources for structuring enemy and NPC behavior systems. It supports Codex in generating realistic decision-making, threat assessment, and group coordination across factions and creature types.

## 📘 General AI & Game Logic

**Name:** *Artificial Intelligence for Games* (Ian Millington)  
**Type:** Game AI Textbook  
**URL:** https://www.crcpress.com/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Games/Millington/p/book/9780367331605  

**Use:** Defines FSMs, behavior trees, steering, goal arbitration, squad behavior, and scripting architectures. Used to implement enemy state logic, patrol routines, and AI reactions to changing threat levels.

---

**Name:** *Game Programming Patterns* — Chapter: State  
**Type:** Programming Design Book  
**URL:** https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html  

**Use:** Establishes clean separation of states and transitions. Supports Codex in structuring enemy AI without condition bloat. Reinforces encapsulation in modular AI modules (e.g. fleeing, aggressive, searching).

## 🧠 Flocking, Group Behavior, and Emergence

**Name:** *Boids: A Distributed Behavioral Model* (Craig Reynolds)  
**Type:** Academic Research Paper  
**URL:** https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/  

**Use:** Guides simulation of flocking, herding, or swarming behavior — useful for Skitterkin, chaos beasts, or environmental emergent agents. Implements alignment, cohesion, and separation rules.

---

**Name:** *Gamasutra – Simple Flock Steering in Unity*  
**Type:** Tutorial/Article  
**URL:** https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/simple-flock-steering-in-unity  

**Use:** Practical breakdown of steering forces, wander, avoidance, and dynamic re-centering — ideal for mid-complexity group AI without full navmesh logic.

## 🪖 Tactical & Combat Behavior

**Name:** *Tactical Decision Making Under Uncertainty*  
**Type:** DoD Research Paper  
**URL:** https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA398684.pdf  

**Use:** Helps Codex model uncertainty, partial information, suppression logic, and conservative/aggressive toggling in AI. Good for ranged enemies, officers, or stealthy opponents.

---

**Name:** *Killology Research Group — Human Aggression Response*  
**Type:** Psychology/Training Paper  
**URL:** https://www.killology.com/conditioned-response-training  

**Use:** Psychological triggers for fight/flee thresholds, startle reactions, and reflexive behavior. Can inform Codex when building fear-based enemies or berserker mode transitions.
