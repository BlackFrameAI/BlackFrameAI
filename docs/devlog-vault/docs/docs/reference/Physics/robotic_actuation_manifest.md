##  Servo Mechanics & Control Systems

**Name:** *How Servos Work  Princeton EduTech Series*  
**Type:** Educational Guide  
**URL:** https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Servomechanism.html  

**Use:** Defines how servos receive and adjust signal instructions. Codex can simulate command latency, PWM drift, or corrupted signal reactions.

---

**Name:** *Robotic Joints & Drives  FANUC Robotics*  
**Type:** Industry Reference  
**URL:** https://www.fanucamerica.com/products/robots/resources/robot-anatomy  

**Use:** Describes motor placement, torque balancing, and failure points. Codex may use this to model fatigue, shutdowns, or robotic limb collisions.

##  Actuator Performance & Feedback Delay

**Name:** *DC Motor and Servo Curve Calculator  Portescap*  
**Type:** Engineering Tool  
**URL:** https://www.portescap.com/en/lp/motor-calculators  

**Use:** Simulates load behavior, efficiency, thermal buildup. Codex can use this to adjust movement speed, jitter, or lag based on entropy or damage.

---

**Name:** *PID Control of Actuators  MIT OCW Robotics*  
**Type:** University Lecture  
**URL:** https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-12-introduction-to-robotics-fall-2005/  

**Use:** Explains proportional-integral-derivative tuning for motion precision. Codex can model oscillations or unstable tracking in damaged enemies.

##  Synthetic Joint Simulation

**Name:** *Robotic Biomechanics  Biorobotics Lab (CMU)*  
**Type:** Research Project  
**URL:** https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biorobotics/projects.html  

**Use:** Includes torque-driven limb motion and adaptive gait planning. Codex may use this for bipedal walkers, synthetic spines, or chaos-reactive balance systems.
